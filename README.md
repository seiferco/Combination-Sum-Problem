# Combination Sum Problem
This project implements a backtracking solution to find all unique combinations of numbers that sum up to a target value. Given an array of numbers and a target, the goal is to find all distinct combinations of numbers from the array that add up to the target without reusing elements.

## Problem Description
Given an array A of integers (which can include duplicate values), the task is to find all unique combinations of elements from A such that their sum equals a given target value S. Each number in A can be used once in each combination.

#### Example
For the input array:
A = [11,1,3,2,6,5]
S = 8

An example output would be:
[[1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 3, 2, 2], [2, 6]]

## How to Run
To run the script, simply execute the following into your terminal: python Amount.py
